# PunkAPI - Pairings

A little app that pairs food with great beer. Type in an ingredient and let Punk API do the rest.

This app uses data from Brewdog's DIY Dog project through https://punkapi.com.

## To run locally
Clone the repo `$ git clone https://github.com/samjbmason/punkapi-pairings`

Then run `$ npm i` and to spin up a local server run `$ npm start`, the site should now be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## Deploying
Probably not very useful for anyone else!

- Run `$ npm run deploy`
- Run `$ npm run alias` to realias the domain to `pairings.punkapi.com`
